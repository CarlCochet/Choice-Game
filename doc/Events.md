## Informations

* When a event like RANDOM, INVVAR or DIALOG set a value in a variable, it will test if a global variable exist before registering it in a temporary variable. So, you can register theses events in a variable like that :
```
VARG IMPORTANTCHOICE 0
DIALOG "What do you want ?" IMPORTANTCHOICE "Pizza" "Icecream"
```
* Check logs when running the game to see if some commands are wrong, they will not be registered to not corrupt the game.

## Examples
### Example 1 (Bed):
```
DIALOG "What do you want to do ?" CHOICE1 "Sleep until morning"  "Sleep until night"  "Cancel"
IF CHOICE1==0
   SAY "You sleep until morning"
   TRIGGER DAY ON
END
IF CHOICE1==1
   SAY "You sleep until night"
   TRIGGER DAY OFF
END
```
### Example 2 (Chest):
```
IF NOT CHEST152 #One time event
   INVVAR 152 KEY152
   IF KEY152>=1
      INVDEL 152 1 "You use " #"{Cl√© de coffre}x1"
      MAPR 0 0 1 CHEST1 1
      SAY "You find some food"
      INVADD 12 1 "You find : " 
      MAPR 0 0 1 CHEST1 0
      TRIGGER CHEST152 ON
   ELSE
      SAY "You don't have this chest's key."
   END
ELSE
   SAY "You already searched this chest."
END
```
